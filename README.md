Have fun playing with the dashboard!

## Quick Start Dashboard with conda
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate decoob
streamlit run dashboard_demo.py
```

## Reproduce Data Preparation
Include the stuutgart_events.json into the deccob directory and run the **step-by-step-walkthrough.ipynb**. (And I know that deccob is spelled differently ðŸ˜„)
